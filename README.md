# hello-world
This code calculates the distance and time between each tracked point with the purpose of finding the average hourly distance traveled per hour for a single fish, which can be used for all fish. The calculated time between each tracked point is only used to check for oddities in the data and is not used in the actual calculation.

Many of the fish have had average hourly distances traveled between 500-1000 m / h.
These numbers seem high for fish that are not migrating, so I am trying to determine if a.) there's an issue with my code, b.) there's maybe an issue with noise/accuracy of acoustic tracking at this level. or c.) the fish really are moving this much.
